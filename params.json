Install [FlashDevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org)\r\n2. Download [Flixel 2.5](http://flixel.org) and put it next to the project, so your directory looks like this:\r\n\r\n    - cave\r\n    - flixel\r\n      - org\r\n        - flixel\r\n          ...\r\n\r\nThen just build and run in FlashDevelop"}
