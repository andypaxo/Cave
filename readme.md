This is a little project to play with Flash / Flixel


The graphics are stolen / adapted from [Oryx's entry to the Assemblee competition](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=8970.0/]).

The soundtrack is from [DJ Chronos](http://www.freesound.org/people/DJ%20Chronos/)

To build:
1. Install [FlashDevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org)
2. Download [Flixel 2.5](http://flixel.org) and put it next to the project, so your directory looks like this:

    - cave
    - flixel
      - org
        - flixel
          ...

Then just build and run in FlashDevelop
